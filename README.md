# 🤖 Autonomous AI Software Engineer

A self-improving autonomous AI agent capable of generating, reviewing, and evolving code using local Large Language Models via Ollama.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Task-based code generation
- Self-review and scoring system
- Tool memory persistence
- Modular multi-agent architecture
- Local LLM execution (Llama3 via Ollama)
- Performance tracking and learning logs

---

## 🧠 Architecture

The system consists of multiple internal agents:

- Planner
- Coder
- Reviewer
- Improver
- Intelligence Engine
- Benchmark Engine

Each task follows this pipeline:

Task → Planning → Code Generation → Debug → Review → Score → Store Tool
